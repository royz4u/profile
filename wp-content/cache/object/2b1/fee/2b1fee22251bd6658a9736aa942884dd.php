As our car passed through the beautiful forests in the ground level and started to reach in the higher altitudes, the temperature started to fall and we can feel the chill along with a touch of beauty. ¬†Being excited to go to the top we started to took a few selfies in the mid of the road and we finally reached on Chitrey on a very cloudy evening patched with light drizzles.

That very night we enjoyed a lot with merriment, songs and music on our dinner table. The next day was the day from where we were supposed to commence our journey.So, it is quite obvious that everyone wanted to have it to their optimum. <strong>Day 2-</strong> An amazing sunrise: We woke up very early in the morning as we perceived some great scenic beauty during the sunrise. The first light came through the mist of a snowy morning spreading gold dusts throughout the valley and air . I noticed some amazing Buddhist monastaries and gumphas there and decided to take snaps as no one wanted to waste a moment even though the temperature was near to freezing in the morning and our hands were getting frozen with a dead feel through the veins.

<strong>Shang</strong> - The holy chants and prayers to God. Just prior to the commencement of our Journey I saw this thing from which there was a fragrance amidst the smokes from a box like thing. It resembled with our 'Dhup Dhuna' cultural way of worship in Bengal. I came to learn the name of this thing as 'Shang', the Nepalese way of worshiping god and before the commencement of the journey it is considered as auspicious.
So, with all the prayers and good wishes we started off for the journey. Our initial steps were joyful and filled with vigorous as we were jumping and dancing with the first few steps taken. Some of us were busy taking the shots and here came the first ascent in the form of a green valley. Our guides and porters told us that if you want to enjoy and shorten the time in the trek you need to take the unusual route i.e through the mountain and not by traversing the regular paths. So, we did. We followed them across the valleys and kept on moving. I stopped for a few steps to take this snap just to give you all an idea of how beautiful our starting point was. <a title="Facebook Profile" href="https://www.facebook.com/chiradeep.chowdhury">Chiradeep Da</a>, coming towards me and that was a fascinating feeling during the initial steps.
