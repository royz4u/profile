We decided to visit some of our references in order to book our dormitories from a local city booking.

Purulia is what mystical places are made of. Incredible natural beauty, elusive tribal folk culture, gorgeous dances, mythological connections and friendly people. And there are springs when the whole district gets stained with the bright red palash flowers. Autumns bring feathery white kaash and summers are dense green. It is nature at its most verdant state and the entire district is one red earth country. Dust rises from its rural lanes in dusty red, brick brown, and deep saffron colours. Oxen patiently plough the grooved yellowish brownfields and deep crimson water lilies cover the glassy ponds. To this sublime natural beauty of Purulia, another shade of red is also often added and that is the colour of <strong><em>Rudra Palash</em></strong> or Africa tulip.

We boarded on from the Howrah station at 11 p.m. and reached the Purulia station in the early morning, 7 a.m. In the month of January, the temperature almost a few degrees lower than what we were used to. We were getting chilled and called our arranger Banu da who was waiting for us with the cars ( we started calling Banu da since 4 a.m )[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:21:"Trip to Ayodhya Hills";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"trip-to-ayodhya-hills";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2019-08-10 18:34:20";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2019-08-10 18:34:20";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:32:"http://www.rajdeeproy.com/?p=245";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
