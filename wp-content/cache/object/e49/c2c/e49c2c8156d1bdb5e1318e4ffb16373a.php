Now, our guide has given us 2 options to choose from, 1. The easiest route or the one flat pitched for the vehicles and automobiles ( as we were starting our journey so initially the roads were just like what we have in our cities, clear and neat) and 2. Across the mountains and valleys ( which will shorten time and distance both ). We chose the 2nd one and it was pretty high and fast to start with. The weather was pretty clear and just this shot was taken of our porters who were always ahead of time from the team. Just to give you all a glimpse of the initial Chitrey traditional roads following was the shot taken -

After walking on for a few miles we were feeling good and slowly feeling the urge to quench our thirst as the sun was bright and high above our head.I think this is the right time to pause and give you all an idea of our entire team.Our teams got divided due to speed, age¬†and different photographic variations in two distinct groups. I was along with two different partners Mr. Chiradeep Chowdhury, an already trek -pro, a teacher in the profession from a renowned government school and Mr.Rupjit Ghosh, a 13-year-old lad of my friend who reads in school. To be honest, he was the most energetic soul throughout the trek. And the other group contained Mr.Pradip Ghosh and his wife Ms. Sujata Ghosh, Mr. Sujay Saha, Mr. Suvojit Srimani &amp; his wife Ms.Rakti Srimany, their 2-year-old¬†child Miss Saranya and another couple Mr. S. Mondal &amp; Ms. P. Mondal.

So after having a small break, we continued our journey and came to the valley of different flowers rare, very rare and rarest of the rare species, Magnolia, Goras and different types of Rhododendrons. We'were just amazed to see them and started pulling out our cameras and apparatus one by one. Not only the place was full of heavenly beauty of flowers but also different types of orchids, plants, and Leafs which one must spend a lifetime to witness unless luck is a well worthy.
