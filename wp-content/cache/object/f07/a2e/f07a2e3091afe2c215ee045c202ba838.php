We came to the conclusion after a few discussion that let's be it and schedule it for the coming year 2016 with 6 months in hand. In that very year, December 2015, we decided to visit some of our references in order to book our dormitories from a local city booking hub for travel and tourisms ( which then turned out to be a blunder ). Route: One of the most important thing in this hiking/trekking is the route and the itinerary. For the beginners, it has always been ¬†Sandakphu and back ( Sandakphu being the topmost point of our state ).¬†Some decided and raised the voice to make a complete traversal of the other places including, Phalut, Gorkhe, Rammam, Sirikhola and Dhotrey but it was a big bait as the altitude and distance both were quite troublesome for the beginners, more than 70 kms total. But, we decided to stick to it without fear or doubts in mind. So, we had the following route.

<img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.darjeeling-tourism.com/darj_i00021b.jpg" alt="Image result for sandakphu trek route" /> <strong>Best Visiting Time -</strong> Generally the ideal time for visiting this zone/route is during the months of October - November when the sky remains crystal clear and view is heavenly, but, due to the shortage of time we couldn't make it in the year of 2015 and stick to the next best season of flowers, March - May . More than 300 species of endangered flowers, shrubs and plants are found during this season and the most famous Rhododendron and Magnolia to name. Equipment and others - Since some part of this trek

<strong>Equipment and others -</strong> Since some part of this trek lie outside of India and many people/trekkers from abroad who visit this route has to carry Passports along with their other identity documents. For Indians, there is an alternative ( due to the tender relationship with Nepal, Bhutan) ¬†not to carry Passport as only other ID proofs will easily do away when you have a good guide. There are some permits and tickets which need to be fulfilled are generally done by the guides.

<strong>a. Guide ¬†&amp; Porters -</strong> A good guide to lead you is the one thing you don't want to miss. We were very lucky to have one and I am sharing the number of this Guide who is very reliable and honest. <strong>Chetan Sherpa - (+91) 9609978884</strong> .You will also be needing a porter if you are not willing to carry your luggage/backpack. Porters will carry a limited weight but I'll suggest carrying the important things ( Dry fruits, Water, Medicines etc ) with you. This way you can easily calculate the route and ration as well and don't have to wait for the porter or other team members. b. Backpacks and Equipment - This is a simple trek if you are doing till Sandakphu, but gets a bit tough if you are to traverse the above route given. So, some basic things which

<strong>b. Backpacks and Equipment -</strong> This is a simple trek if you are doing till <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandakphu">Sandakphu</a>, but gets a bit tough if you are to traverse the above route given. So, some basic things which are required - A Good backpack/trekking bag, ¬†Windcheaters or heavy jackets ( if you visit during December), Gloves, Woolen Mufflers, 2 Pairs of Shoes ( must ), Lower Track Pants , Inners, Winter Wears, Walking Stick ( Optional), ¬†Small Knife / Swiss Knife,Sunglass, Camera ( if you don't want to miss those heavenly views ), Power Bank and a watch.

<strong>c. Foods &amp; Medicine-</strong> Dry Fruits like Nuts, Dates, Almonds, Chocolates, Water (carried and calculated every day with distance )* ,¬†Medicines for Stomach Related problems, Cough, Fever ( you don't have common cold and fever there though), Vitamins are a must as your lips will crack and swell, Coca 30 for the people with light breathing problems due to high altitude.

* At least 2 bottles of water to be carried, upto Sandakphu you might find fountains with amazing crystal and sweet water but thereafter as you go top nothing is there, so keep checking of your daily water limit as per distance.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Cell phone / other signals will be cut off after Chitrey up to ¬†Rammam as everything runs in Solar. If you are lucky you will receive signals while standing in some latitudes and longitudes only! #lol

On the very auspicious day, that we started 19th March, it was a Saturday and we were having a famous <strong><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2016/engine/current/match/951341.html">India vs Pakistan Match</a></strong> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>. The day started with a bright sunshine but in the afternoon dark clouds covered the sky and we had a torrential rain for a couple of hours. I went to the temple for worship ( on a regular basis) ¬†and pray for the auspicious day and our trek success. In the evening, the weather was crystal clear and the sky was full of twinkling stars along with the big bright silver moon. We had a train scheduled from Sealdah to NJP at 11:05 pm and the team gathered, everyone elated with joy and excitement!! Whoo! Finally, we were rolling :)
